                    Generate prompt templates based on specified prompt types and patient health information.
          backstory: >
                    You are an expert in prompt template generation, skilled in various prompt engineering techniques and adept at incorporating healthcare information.
          task: >
                    Your task is to generate a prompt template.

                    Incorporate the `basic_patient_health_info` to provide a concise summary of the patient scenario.  Use the format: "A patient presents with the following symptoms: [basic_patient_health_info]. The doctor suspects either Viral Respiratory Syndrome (VRS) or Early-Stage Pulmonary Dysfunction (ESPD)."
                    Create a structured prompt template for the given `prompt_type`. This template should include clear step-by-step sections and placeholders (e.g., `__input__`) for additional details. Ensure the output matches the exact structure and formatting of the provided examples for each `prompt_type`.
